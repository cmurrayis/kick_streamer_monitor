# Tasks: Kick Streamer Status Monitor MVP

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-kick-monitor-this/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Context**: Create an MVP version of this app that I can test against the official Kick.com services

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.11+, asyncio, websockets, psycopg3, pydantic, pytest
   → Structure: Single project (src/, tests/)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Streamer, StatusEvent, Configuration entities
   → contracts/: kick-api.yaml, websocket-events.yaml, cli-interface.yaml
   → quickstart.md: Test scenarios and setup validation
3. Generate MVP tasks focusing on core functionality:
   → Production-ready integration with official Kick.com OAuth and WebSocket APIs
   → Real-time WebSocket monitoring with database updates
   → CLI interface for production testing and management
4. Apply TDD ordering: Contract tests → Integration tests → Implementation
5. Mark parallel tasks [P] for independent files/components
```

## Dependencies

**Critical Dependencies (Sequential)**:
- Setup (T001-T004) before all tests
- All tests (T005-T012) before any implementation (T013+)
- Models (T013-T016) before services (T017-T020)
- Services before CLI implementation (T021-T025)
- Core functionality before integration (T026-T029)
- Implementation before validation (T030-T039)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Contract tests T005-T008 can run together
- Integration tests T009-T012 can run together  
- Data models T013-T016 can be created in parallel
- CLI command modules T021-T024 can be implemented in parallel
- Unit tests T030-T031 and documentation T035-T037 can be done in parallel

## MVP Parallel Execution Examples

### Contract Tests Phase
```bash
# Launch T005-T008 together (different files):
Task: "Contract test Kick.com OAuth token endpoint against live API in tests/contract/test_kick_oauth.py"
Task: "Contract test Kick.com channel info endpoint against live API in tests/contract/test_kick_channels.py"
Task: "Contract test WebSocket event schemas against live Pusher service in tests/contract/test_websocket_events.py"
Task: "Contract test CLI interface commands with real API calls in tests/contract/test_cli_interface.py"
```

### Data Models Phase
```bash
# Launch T013-T016 together (independent entities):
Task: "Streamer model in src/models/streamer.py with validation and state transitions"
Task: "StatusEvent model in src/models/status_event.py with event types and timestamps"
Task: "Configuration model in src/models/configuration.py with environment variable support"
Task: "Database schema creation script in src/models/schema.sql with indexes and constraints"
```

### CLI Commands Phase
```bash
# Launch T021-T024 together (separate command modules):
Task: "CLI configuration commands in src/cli/config.py (show, validate, generate-template)"
Task: "CLI streamer management commands in src/cli/streamers.py (list, test)"
Task: "CLI service commands in src/cli/service.py (start, stop, status)"
Task: "CLI database commands in src/cli/database.py (migrate, health)"
```

## MVP Testing Strategy

### Production API Testing Requirements
1. **Live API Integration**: Real Kick.com OAuth and WebSocket connections
2. **Production Database**: PostgreSQL for all testing scenarios
3. **API Credentials**: Valid Kick.com ClientID and Client Secret required
4. **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respect official API rate limits and best practices

### Validation Scenarios (from quickstart.md)
1. **Configuration Validation**: `kick-monitor config validate` succeeds
2. **Database Setup**: `kick-monitor db migrate` creates schema successfully
3. **Live Streaming**: Monitor real Kick.com streamers for online/offline events
4. **Status Updates**: Verify database updates from real events within expected timeframe  
5. **Error Recovery**: Test with actual API errors and network failures

## Production API Requirements

### Prerequisites for Testing Against Official Kick.com Services
1. **Developer Account**: Register at https://dev.kick.com/ to obtain API credentials
2. **Application Registration**: Create application to get ClientID and Client Secret
3. **OAuth Setup**: Configure redirect URIs and scopes (user:read, channel:read, events:subscribe)
4. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL instance with proper permissions
5. **Network Access**: Ensure firewall allows WebSocket connections to Kick.com

### Official API Endpoints Used
- **OAuth Server**: `https://id.kick.com/oauth/token`
- **REST API**: `https://kick.com/api/v1/channels/{username}`
- **WebSocket**: Kick.com Pusher service (endpoint discovered via API)

### Rate Limiting & Compliance
- Respect official API rate limits (details from research.md)
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Handle 429 (Too Many Requests) responses gracefully

## Notes for MVP Implementation

- **Production Authentication**: Full OAuth 2.1 implementation for live Kick.com API integration
- **Real WebSocket Connection**: Direct connection to Kick.com Pusher service with proper authentication
- **PostgreSQL Required**: Production database setup required for realistic testing
- **API Registration**: Requires valid Kick.com developer account and registered application
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper backoff and retry logic for API compliance
- **Documentation**: Focus on production deployment and API integration setup

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: Each YAML file → contract test task [P]
2. **From Data Model**: Each entity → model creation task [P]  
3. **From User Stories**: Each quickstart scenario → integration test [P]
4. **Production MVP Focus**: Core monitoring loop with full Kick.com API integration

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts (kick-api, websocket-events, cli-interface) have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities (Streamer, StatusEvent, Configuration) have model tasks
- [x] All tests (T005-T012) come before implementation (T013+)
- [x] Parallel tasks [P] are truly independent (different files/modules)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path for implementation
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Production MVP focus maintained throughout task breakdown
