# Implementation Plan: Kick Streamer Status Monitor

**Branch**: `001-kick-monitor-this` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-kick-monitor-this/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Real-time monitoring service that connects to Kick.com's Pusher WebSocket service to track streamer online/offline status changes and updates a PostgreSQL database. Service authenticates with Kick.com API, handles connection failures and token expiration, and operates as a system service on Debian 12+.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (fast, efficient, excellent websocket/async support)  
**Primary Dependencies**: asyncio, websockets, psycopg3, pydantic, python-dotenv  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (existing database with streamer configuration)  
**Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async testing  
**Target Platform**: Debian 12+ Linux server as systemd service
**Project Type**: single (monitoring service/daemon)  
**Performance Goals**: <1 second status update latency, handle 1000+ concurrent streamers  
**Constraints**: Minimal memory footprint, auto-recovery from failures, secure credential storage  
**Scale/Scope**: Monitor unlimited streamers, 24/7 uptime, handle API rate limits

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (monitor service only)
- Using framework directly? (Yes - asyncio, websockets directly)
- Single data model? (Yes - Streamer entity with status)
- Avoiding patterns? (Yes - direct database access, no unnecessary abstractions)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (Yes - monitor-lib with CLI interface)
- Libraries listed: kick-monitor-lib (websocket monitoring + database updates)
- CLI per library: kick-monitor --help/--version/--config/--dry-run
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? (Yes)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (Yes - tests written first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (Yes - contract tests first)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? (Yes)
- Real dependencies used? (Yes - actual PostgreSQL and WebSocket connections)
- Integration tests for: WebSocket connection, database updates, token refresh
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase (Enforced)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (Yes - JSON formatted logs)
- Frontend logs → backend? (N/A - single service)
- Error context sufficient? (Yes - connection state, streamer context, error codes)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (1.0.0)
- BUILD increments on every change? (Yes)
- Breaking changes handled? (N/A for initial implementation)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - monitoring service with CLI interface

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract testing: Each API endpoint → contract test task [P]
- Data modeling: Each entity (Streamer, StatusEvent, Configuration) → model creation task [P]
- Integration testing: Each user story → integration test task
- Service implementation: Authentication, WebSocket, Database services
- CLI implementation: Commands and interface
- Service deployment: Systemd integration and packaging

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Unit tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Database layer → Services → CLI → Deployment
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/components)
- Critical path: Authentication → WebSocket connection → Database updates

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Contract Tests [P]**: Kick.com API, WebSocket events, CLI interface validation
2. **Data Models [P]**: Streamer, StatusEvent, Configuration entities with validation
3. **Integration Tests**: Database operations, WebSocket event handling, end-to-end flow
4. **Core Services**: OAuth authentication, Pusher WebSocket client, database manager
5. **CLI Interface**: Command parsing, configuration management, service control
6. **Service Setup**: Systemd configuration, logging, error handling
7. **Documentation**: CLI help, configuration examples, deployment guide

**Estimated Output**: 32-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Contract tests can run independently
- Data model creation can be done in parallel
- CLI commands can be implemented concurrently
- Documentation tasks can be done alongside implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
