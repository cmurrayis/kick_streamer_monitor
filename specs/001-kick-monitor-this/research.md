# Research: Kick Streamer Status Monitor

## Authentication Decision
**Decision**: Use official Kick.com OAuth 2.1 with Client Credentials flow for server-to-server authentication  
**Rationale**: Official API provides secure, supported authentication mechanism with proper token management  
**Alternatives considered**: Unofficial authentication methods rejected due to security and reliability concerns

### Implementation Details:
- OAuth server: `https://id.kick.com`
- Token endpoint: `https://id.kick.com/oauth/token`
- Required scopes: `user:read channel:read events:subscribe`
- Python library: `requests-oauthlib` for OAuth handling

## WebSocket Connection Decision
**Decision**: Hybrid approach - official REST API + community WebSocket libraries for real-time events  
**Rationale**: Official WebSocket support not yet available, but community has stable implementations  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Polling REST endpoints (too slow for real-time)
- Webhooks (requires public server, not suitable for private monitoring)

### Implementation Details:
- Use `pusher-py` library for WebSocket connections
- Implement connection retry with exponential backoff
- Monitor community projects for official WebSocket API availability

## Database Integration Decision
**Decision**: Direct PostgreSQL connection using `psycopg3` with async support  
**Rationale**: Simple, efficient, matches existing database infrastructure  
**Alternatives considered**: SQLAlchemy ORM rejected (unnecessary complexity for simple status updates)

### Implementation Details:
- Connection pooling for reliability
- Prepared statements for status updates
- Async database operations to avoid blocking WebSocket handling

## Service Architecture Decision
**Decision**: Single Python asyncio service with systemd integration and manual mode support  
**Rationale**: Efficient resource usage, simple deployment, excellent async WebSocket support, rich console UI capabilities  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Go (good performance but more complex WebSocket ecosystem and limited TUI libraries)
- Node.js (good WebSocket support but higher memory usage, limited console UI options)

### Implementation Details:
- Service structure: monitor-lib library + CLI interface
- Async/await pattern for concurrent streamer monitoring
- JSON structured logging for observability
- Manual mode: Real-time console UI with Rich library for formatted display

## Error Handling Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Comprehensive retry mechanisms with circuit breaker pattern  
**Rationale**: WebSocket connections are inherently unstable, authentication tokens expire  
**Alternatives considered**: Simple retry rejected (insufficient for production reliability)

### Implementation Details:
- Exponential backoff for connection retries
- Token refresh automation on 401 errors
- Database connection pooling with auto-recovery
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints

## Configuration Management Decision
**Decision**: Environment variables via `.env` file with Pydantic validation  
**Rationale**: Secure, simple, follows 12-factor app principles  
**Alternatives considered**: Config files rejected (more complex, harder to secure)

### Implementation Details:
- `python-dotenv` for environment loading
- `pydantic-settings` for configuration validation
- Separate configs for development/production environments

## Testing Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Pytest with real external dependencies for integration tests  
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for testing with real systems  
**Alternatives considered**: Mocked tests rejected (don't catch real-world integration issues)

### Implementation Details:
- Contract tests for Kick.com API responses
- Integration tests with test PostgreSQL database
- WebSocket connection tests with actual Pusher endpoints
- End-to-end tests simulating full monitoring cycle

## Deployment Decision
**Decision**: Systemd service on Debian 12+ with automatic restart capabilities  
**Rationale**: Native Linux service management, automatic recovery, logging integration  
**Alternatives considered**: Docker rejected (unnecessary complexity for single service)

### Implementation Details:
- Systemd unit file with restart policies
- Log rotation and monitoring integration
- Graceful shutdown handling for WebSocket connections
- Service dependencies for database availability

## Performance Optimization Decision
**Decision**: Connection pooling and async batch processing for database updates  
**Rationale**: Minimize database load while maintaining real-time responsiveness  
**Alternatives considered**: Individual database writes rejected (too much overhead)

### Implementation Details:
- Batch status updates every 100ms or 10 updates (whichever comes first)
- PostgreSQL connection pool size: 5-10 connections
- Memory-based buffering for pending updates
- Metrics collection for monitoring performance

## Manual Mode UI Decision
**Decision**: Rich library for terminal-based real-time interface  
**Rationale**: Professional console UI, excellent async support, cross-platform compatibility  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Curses (too complex, poor Windows support)
- Textual (overkill for simple status display)
- Custom ANSI codes (too much manual work)

### Implementation Details:
- Rich Live display for real-time updates
- Table layout with streamer status columns
- Color coding: Green (online), Red (offline), Yellow (unknown)
- Status indicators: connection health, API rate limiting
- Keyboard shortcuts: 'q' to quit, 'r' to refresh, 's' to sort
- Header: timestamp, total streamers, connection status
- Auto-refresh every 1-2 seconds

## Security Considerations
**Decision**: Principle of least privilege with credential rotation support  
**Rationale**: Minimize attack surface and follow security best practices  

### Implementation Details:
- Environment-based secret management
- No credentials in code or logs
- Token refresh automation
- Network communication over TLS only
- Database connection encryption required
