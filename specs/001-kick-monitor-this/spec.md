# Feature Specification: Kick Streamer Status Monitor

**Feature Branch**: `001-kick-monitor-this`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Kick Monitor - This script be used to monitor the status of streamers on the kick.com platform. The purpose of this is to update the status (Online / Offline) of a list of streamers which have configured in a postgres database to which we will provide access to. The script will monitor for the list of users in the database. The script does not need add/remove funcationality for the users as this is managed elsewhere. The script needs to use the official kick.com pusher to monitor the status of online/offline events and update the database accordingly. The script needs to handle running as a service on a Debian 12+ host and manage errors in the pusher websocket, errors with expired tokens etc. The script needs to access  the ClientID and Client Secret to which needs to be stored securley along with the database access method & credentials outside the main script eg a .env file or similar. The primary goal is the update the database with the status of the streamers as close to real time as possible."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to automatically monitor the online/offline status of Kick.com streamers in real-time so that the database remains current with accurate streamer availability information for downstream applications and users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a streamer in the database goes online on Kick.com, **When** the Kick platform sends a status change event, **Then** the system updates the streamer's status to "Online" in the database within seconds
2. **Given** a streamer goes offline on Kick.com, **When** the platform sends the offline event, **Then** the system updates the streamer's status to "Offline" in the database within seconds
3. **Given** the monitoring service is running as a system service, **When** the server restarts, **Then** the service automatically starts and resumes monitoring without manual intervention
4. **Given** the websocket connection is interrupted, **When** the connection fails, **Then** the system automatically attempts to reconnect and continues monitoring
5. **Given** authentication tokens expire, **When** the API returns authentication errors, **Then** the system refreshes tokens and continues operation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the database connection is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle duplicate status change events?
- What occurs when a streamer is removed from the database while being monitored?
- How does the system behave during extended Kick.com service outages?
- What happens if configuration files are corrupted or missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate correctly with the Kick.com API to obtain the required tokens to access the Kick.com Pusher Websocket connection
- **FR-002**: System MUST monitor real-time status changes (online/offline) for all streamers configured in the database
- **FR-003**: System MUST update streamer status in the database as close to instantly is possible
- **FR-004**: System MUST read the list of streamers to monitor from a PostgreSQL database
- **FR-005**: System MUST connect to Kick.com's official pusher service to receive real-time status events
- **FR-006**: System MUST operate as a background service on Debian 12+ systems
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically restart monitoring after system reboots
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle websocket connection failures by attempting reconnection
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle authentication token expiration by refreshing credentials
- **FR-010**: System MUST store sensitive configuration (ClientID, Client Secret, database credentials) in secure external configuration files
- **FR-011**: System MUST log operational events for monitoring and debugging
- **FR-012**: System MUST gracefully handle database connection failures with retry logic
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent duplicate status updates for the same streamer state
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate that streamers exist in the database before attempting to update their status
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle new streamers being added to the database without needing to restart the process

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Streamer**: Represents a Kick.com content creator with attributes including unique identifier, username, and current online/offline status
- **Status Event**: Represents a real-time notification from Kick.com indicating a streamer's state change
- **Configuration**: Contains authentication credentials, database connection details, and monitoring parameters stored securely outside the application
